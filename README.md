# An example Python projet

An example project that is used as a practice project for learning [packaging][pcking].

This project does not aim to cover best practices for Python project
development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool
recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.

Most of the configuration for a Python project is done in the `setup.py` file,
an example of which is included in this project.

This is the README file for the project.
