# An example Python projet

An example project that is used as a practice project for [packaging][pcking].

This project does not aim to cover best practices for Python project
development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool
recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.

Most of the configuration for a Python project is done in the `setup.py` file,
an example of which is included in this project.

----

This is the README file for the project.

Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not a
good idea, although a simple “What's New” section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.
